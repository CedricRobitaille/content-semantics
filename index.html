    <p>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.</p>
    <p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
    <p>The usually deep purple roots of <b>beetroot</b> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
    <p>In fact, Jim Halpert once said this about beets, “Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, <i>Battlestar Galactica”</i>.</p>
    <p>I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.</p>
